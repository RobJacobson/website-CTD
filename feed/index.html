<p>Recently, CTD Co-founder and Board Member Daisy Magnus-Aryitey spoke with New America to talk about her origins in technology, her work here at Code the Dream, and why public interest technology is important work for the health and growth of our communities.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The potential of technology is colliding at this moment in time with the horrors of technology. We&#8217;re at a point where we realize that the social ills and the social injustices can either be exasperated by tech, or they can be alleviated by technology. We all have to make that intentional decision. Are we going to alleviate these problems with technology?</p></blockquote></figure>

<h3><strong>On finding Code the Dream:</strong></h3>



<p><em>&#8220;I came to the United States two years ago from Colombia, where I studied IndustrialEngineering for six years in college. When I first moved to the US, I had tried to study coding by myself, but I felt I needed more structure and guidance. So when I heard about Code the Dream through [the San Francisco-based outreach organization] Code Tenderloin, I applied and was accepted into a class in 2020.&#8221;</em></p>



<h3><strong>On the student experience:</strong></h3>



<p><em>&#8220;I really liked CTD’s class structure. The combination of videos (which I could rewatch until I was confident that I had learned the information) and mentor sessions were great. The mentors, in particular, made a strong impression on me as they were always so willing to help and speak with me any time.&#8221;</em></p>



<h3><strong>On the apprenticeship experience:</strong></h3>



<p><em>&#8220;[At CTD Labs] we had a good team and it was a good experience to put everything together that we had learned, so we could see how it works in the real world — assigning tasks, doing real work, etc.&#8221;</em></p>



<h3><strong>Favorite thing about Code the Dream:</strong></h3>



<p><em>&#8220;I want them to know that Code the Dream is a wonderful organization, that they really care about people, that they believe that giving opportunities really can make the difference to make a better society, that they appreciate you for who you are, and that no matter your background, the color of your skin or your beliefs, you are always welcome and loved.&#8221;</em></p>



<h3><strong>How has your life changed since Code the Dream?</strong></h3>



<p><em>&#8220;Being at Code the Dream has been a wonderful experience. I learned how to make front-end and back-end applications. I made many friends and had the opportunity to improve my English and bring out my leadership skills. Before Code the Dream I used to be a delivery guy, now I&#8217;m a Software Engineer at Airbnb. Being a student, apprentice and part of the Code the Dream family totally changed my life and I will always be grateful for so much that they do so that people like me can code their dreams.&#8221;</em></p>

<p><strong>What kinds of work were you doing before Code the Dream?</strong> I was a college student.</p>



<p><strong>What has your experience been like at Code the Dream?</strong> Everyone at Code the Dream doesn’t treat it like another “job.” They are super nice and super helpful. I would recommend Code the Dream to any family member or friend.</p>



<p><strong>What do you like about Code the Dream?</strong> I like that Code the Dream is remote. It makes it easier for me, especially now. Also, my questions are answered in a timely manner when I run into issues.</p>



<p><strong>If you could build any app, what would it do?</strong> I’m actually working on an app now for my final project that lets people become a student at Hogwarts from Harry Potter.</p>

<p>On April 30th, Code the Dream co-founders Dan Rearick and Daisy Magnus-Aryitey shared their thoughts in an op-ed with the News &amp; Observer about what impact Apple and Google will have on the region after both companies announced their plans to expand into the Triangle. Here&#8217;s an excerpt:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This week, Apple announced plans for a $1 billion RTP campus, with up to 3,000 new jobs. This comes on the heels of Google’s Durham announcement last month.</p><p>That’s exciting news. If nothing else, it’s cool to think that some part of the newest Apple or Google technology may be designed right down the road by one of our neighbors.</p><p>But which neighbors will benefit most? Who is likely to get those thousands of new six-figure salary jobs?</p></blockquote>

<p>On Friday, IBM announced <a href="https://www.wraltechwire.com/2021/05/07/ibm-expands-its-global-university-program-to-40-hbcus/">it is expanding its Global University Program</a> to 40 historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) through a $100 million investment in faculty, guest lecturers, cloud storage, and other components necessary for educating those interested in working in tech. IBM — one of Research Triangle Park’s long-standing tenants — has an established relationship with North Carolina, which is home to <a href="https://www.ourstate.com/the-state-of-north-carolinas-hbcus/">12 HBCUs</a>.</p>



<p>After recent announcements that Google and Apple will be opening major campuses in the Triangle, Code the Dream co-founders Dan Rearick and Daisy Magnus-Aryitey <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/article251034104.html">authored an op-ed for the News &amp; Observer</a> to express excitement and concern for the arrival of the tech giants to the region.</p>



<p>One of the ways they suggest growing a diverse tech workforce is investment in our local HBUCs. We appreciate IBM’s commitment to supporting our historically black colleges and look forward to other businesses in the area following their lead.</p>

<p>For the past year, we’ve had the pleasure of working with Petra Holešínská, UNC graduate student and varsity basketball player hailing from the Czech Republic. Petra has been instrumental in helping us use our social media platforms to spotlight the amazing students and apprentices here at Code the Dream, as well as other important historical figures throughout US history that had a major impact on science and technology.</p>



<p>“My time at Code the Dream has been awesome. Everyone has been extremely helpful and welcoming from my first day here, which made the transition really easy. I got to improve my social media skills, while getting to know the people that make CTD so special. I want to thank Lori &amp; Justin for their support and guidance. This organization is truly amazing and I’m forever grateful for the opportunity to be a part of it.”</p>



<p>Petra is set to graduate this month with her Master’s degree in Educational Innovation, Technology and Entrepreneurship. Afterwards, she plans to continue pursuing a professional basketball career in the WNBA and overseas. We will miss working with Petra but couldn’t be more excited to see where her career takes her next!</p>

<p>Sintu moved to the United States with her family five years ago and didn’t have any real IT experience at that time. After volunteering in Atlanta, Georgia, she joined Code the Dream as a student before eventually becoming a front-end developer. Being new to coding, Sintu really appreciates how helpful has everyone been throughout this process: ‘’Code the Dream means collaborations and teamwork. All of the people here are very welcoming and helpful.  Working on different projects, you learn about the diversity and people’s backgrounds. I like that because so many different people can join.’’ She really enjoys working on real life projects because that’s something she didn’t get to experience before CTD: ‘’After I joined Code the Dream, it was real environment and real projects and I just knew that I wanted to be a software developer because I enjoyed working on real projects.’’ One of her favorite things about the organization is its diversity. Every day, she gets to work with diverse backgrounds: ‘’CTD is a place where everyone is accepted without any limitations. You get to work with many people and there is a lot of diversity. It is the right place for everyone no matter their background and without exclusions. I love this experience and I would recommend it to everyone.‘‘</p>

<p>Selamawit is originally from Ethiopia and she moved to the U.S. in 2018 after winning the diversity visa lottery. She has a background in civil engineering, but she also got the chance to learn coding during her bachelor’s study. After working as a cashier for over a year and receiving her Master’s degree in software development, she joined CTD in October 2020 for an internship. Her favorite thing about Code the Dream is the family atmosphere: ‘’For me, Code the Dream is family. We help each other, we share our experiences, since most of the people are from different countries. It feels like I’m somewhere with my family and friends. Everyone supports us whenever we need help or just have a question during coding. I love working with these people and I’m never scared to ask questions because everyone is so friendly. I just really like it.’’ Selamawit has always enjoyed volunteering and working with people with different backgrounds and Code the Dream gives her an opportunity to do that: ‘‘The people working here are from different countries, which creates multicultural environment and diversity of culture. I like that environment.’’</p>
