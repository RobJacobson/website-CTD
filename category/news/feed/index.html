<p><strong>RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK –</strong>&nbsp;Code the Dream, an organization that provides computer programming classes to people from diverse and low-income backgrounds, is opening a second office.</p>



<p>Launched in Durham at American Underground, the nonprofit is opening a new office at The Frontier campus in Research Triangle Park.</p>



<p>The group says the new office is a response to “demand for its programs.”</p>



<p><a href="http://codethedream.org/">Code the Dream</a>&nbsp;often hires many of the students that take its classes to develop websites and create apps for clients.</p>



<p>“It’s a win-win opportunity,” explained Executive Director Dan Rearick about Code the Dream. “Students gain real-world experience that looks great on their resumes; new businesses get launched; and nonprofits get tools that help them better serve those in need.”</p>



<p>Rearick and Romero Rodriguez founded the group.</p>



<p>In 2018, WRAL.com described Code the Dream as “a program that gives people from under-represented populations an entry point into the tech industry.”</p>



<p>Magnus-Aryitey, who is originally from Ghana, is the director of Code the Dream, having taken courses with the group before landing a job at Duke University. Shen then returned to Code the Dream.</p>



<p>“Our students are usually first-generation Americans, recent immigrants, minorities, women or people from low-income backgrounds,” she told WRAL.</p>



<p>Her success is not unique.</p>



<p>“Code the Dream alumni have gone on to work as software developers for a range of startups and large employers, including IBM, AT&amp;T and Duke University,” the nonprofit says.</p>



<p>Students at Code the Dream have developed numerous apps such as for homeless parents who need rides to get to interviews or medical exams.</p>



<p>“It’s like free Uber for the people who need it most,” said Magnus-Aryitey.</p>



<p>Another app helps people track issues and legislation at the N.C. General Assembly.</p>



<p>Code the Dream has been hired by numerous clients with development work from students supervised by software mentors.</p>

<p style="text-align:center" class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Advocates Say Durham’s Experiment to Wipe Thousands of Old Cases Off the Books Could Be a Model for Statewide Justice Reform</strong></p>



<p><strong>Linwood Thornton had just accepted</strong>&nbsp;that he’d never drive legally again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His license had been suspended since June 2, 1989. A relative used his identity and got a speeding ticket that January, he says, and he didn’t know about it until he was pulled over that September, after spending three months in prison. Only then did he learn his license had been suspended for missing the court date, which he thinks occurred while he was locked up. (Court and jail records don’t go back far enough to confirm all of his story.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thornton went on with his life. He and his wife had five kids, and he started a home improvement business. But the suspension loomed over him. It limited what jobs he could take and what vehicles he could add to his business. It cost him time spent waiting for rides. And when he had no choice but to drive, he got new tickets for driving with a revoked license, which he couldn’t afford to pay—and three more license suspensions, a cycle that seemed insurmountable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eventually, he gave up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So when he and his wife, Rosa Ann—whose license is also suspended—first heard from his brother’s girlfriend about something called the Durham Expunction and Restoration program, an initiative that began in December to connect people to free legal help with license restoration, he thought it was too good to be true.</p>



<p>“I just thought someone was jiving. I didn’t think it was real,” says Thornton, a tall man with an affable twang. “Me and my baby jumped up and boogied to the courthouse.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>On January 23, they arrived on the sixth floor of the Durham County courthouse, where DEAR shares a space with the county drug court. Five other people were in the waiting room talking about all they’d lost because they couldn’t legally drive.</p>



<p>“All our stories are the same,” Thornton said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One woman said she spent nearly $100 a week on ride-sharing services to get to work at Durham Public Schools. If she had to drive—when she didn’t have the money or couldn’t get a ride—she was too anxious to turn the radio on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If you don’t have a license, you don’t really have nothing,” a man added, eliciting knowing nods. “If you don’t have a license, it’s like you don’t exist.”</p>



<p>While other counties provide assistance for those with license suspensions, Durham’s model—a collaboration between the city of Durham, the courts, the NC Justice Center, Legal Aid, the NC Equal Access to Justice Commission, the NC Pro Bono Resource Center, local law schools, and Code for Durham—offers relief on an unprecedented scale, and not just for traffic issues, but for lingering criminal charges as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By early March, DEAR had had dismissed more than 70,000 cases (most for traffic charges tied to license suspensions), waived more than $200,000 in unpaid traffic fines and court fees (on average thirteen years old) for more than 1,200 people, and helped more than 120 others start the process of getting their criminal records expunged.</p>



<p>The program isn’t doing anything not already allowed under state law. Instead, its attorneys and partners are using data and court records to maximize access to existing methods of assistance, under the belief that a justice system that disproportionately targets low-income people and communities of color should bear responsibility for correcting those disparities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other counties are watching to see how Durham’s experiment with mass relief works out. The program’s advocates think it could be a model that’s eventually rolled out across the state. If there’s enough political will—and enough resources—they say, hundreds of thousands of residents could be given second chances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It is a second chance, but the law gives this second chance to everyone, so everyone should have the opportunity to get it,” says District Court Judge Amanda Maris. “If you want to take it deeper, you have to ask the question—for some, were you given a first chance?”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://indyweek.com/downloads/72678/download/190311_AB_RyanSmith_0014.jpg?cb=3609ddde0b23ef56c12f6a5632a84e2a&amp;w=640" alt="190311_AB_RyanSmith_0014.jpg"/><figcaption>Ryan Smith, I-Team director<br></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The DEAR program began</strong>&nbsp;years before it had a name or a spot on the courthouse directory.</p>



<p>Its license restoration work grew out of an effort by the Durham Innovation Team and the District Attorney’s Office to help suspended drivers. Backed by a $1.2 million Bloomberg Philanthropies grant and tasked with looking at how to reduce economic barriers for justice-involved people, the I-Team found that more than fifty-four thousand Durham residents had their licenses suspended for either failing to appear in court for traffic offenses—like speeding or lapsed registration—or for not paying court fees and fines related to traffic violations. These cases go back to 1987. Most involve people of color.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In North Carolina, licenses are suspended indefinitely for failure to appear or failure to pay. That’s left about 1.2 million North Carolinians unable to drive legally, according to an analysis by the Legal Aid Justice Center—about 15 percent of the state’s driving-age population. The suspension happens automatically, regardless of the person’s ability to pay—which prompted civil rights groups to sue the state last year, alleging that the law violated due process and equal protection rights. The suspension isn’t reversed until the underlying reason is resolved—in other words, when the person comes to court or pays their debt. And even this doesn’t automatically restore driving privileges; people still need to take a driving test, get insurance, and pay up to $115 in fees to have their licenses restored.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the I-Team and the DA’s Office held a driver amnesty program in 2017, about five hundred people got their outstanding charges dismissed. But almost as many ended up not being eligible.</p>



<p>“We just had to do something again because so many people were saying they needed help,” says Superior Court Judge Josephine Kerr Davis, who led the program as an assistant district attorney.</p>



<p>Around the same time, Maris, a former public defender, was trying to bring together organizations that help with expunctions, or court orders that scrub old charges and convictions from criminal records.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maris saw an opportunity to reach more people. A 2017 state law had expanded who was eligible: It shortened mandatory waiting periods to expunge convictions and, significantly, eliminated a once-in-a-lifetime limit on expunging charges that resulted in a dismissal or not-guilty finding. Yet Durham residents filed only 383 expungement petitions that year. In the previous five years, eighty-seven thousand charges had been dismissed or ended with a not-guilty verdict in the county.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The I-Team suggested bringing license restoration and expunction under the same umbrella. The Durham Expunction and Restoration Clinic, or DEAR, was born. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Both sides of the initiative seek to solve cyclical problems: License suspensions lead to more tickets, which lead to more suspensions, “especially if you live in a community where the police are very prevalent,” says District Attorney Satana Deberry. These suspensions can not only keep people from getting around, but they can also disqualify people from jobs and even lead to jail time over unpaid debt. They often far outlast whatever punishment a court would have handed down for the underlying offense.</p>



<p>In the same way, a criminal record is often a barrier to employment and housing after people have completed their sentences. With limited options, they’re more likely to re-offend.</p>



<p>To get an expunction or a license restored, people need lawyers, but most people who need them don’t have the means to hire one. The result is a huge gap between the number of people who are eligible to get help and those who actually do.</p>



<p>“The justice system breaks down when we don’t have full access,” says Maris. “[DEAR] is about expanding access to relief that already exists but isn’t equally being doled out.”</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>A&nbsp;few months in,</strong>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>R</em>&nbsp;part of DEAR—restoration—is further along than expunction. The I-Team already had license suspension data and experience from the amnesty program. Restoration is also easier to tackle on a large scale. While a person has to file a petition to have a record expunged, that’s not the case with restorations: District attorneys can dismiss charges (including those tied to license suspensions) and judges can waive fines and fees without the suspended driver doing a thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learning from the 2017 amnesty program, DEAR’s partners decided to set broad eligibility criteria—cases must be at least two years old, and “high-risk” violations such as driving while impaired and trying to elude arrest are eliminated—proactively identify people who qualify, and dismiss the underlying charge or ask a judge to cancel the unpaid debt.</p>



<p>Other Triangle jurisdictions were already addressing suspended licenses before Durham developed DEAR. Wake County, for instance, has been doing license-restoration clinics for years, and it’s now creating a court session for judges to forgive unpaid traffic debts. Likewise, the Orange County DA’s Office has asked its Board of Commissioners for an additional position to help process license suspensions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The difference: These are done on a case-by-case basis. That approach is safer, holds people accountable, and is fairer to people who resolved their traffic cases, argues Orange County assistant district attorney Jeff Nieman. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“We just don’t think it’s necessarily the best message to send to the public that we went in and just dismissed seventy thousand tickets,” Nieman says “That’s incredibly efficient, but inevitably, you run the risk of being less fair. Are you dismissing charges for someone who is a repeat traffic offender, and the public would expect there should be some more accountability?”</p>



<p>Deberry and assistant district attorney Dale Morrill, the main Durham prosecutor working with the DEAR program, say everyone benefitting from DEAR&nbsp;<em>has</em>&nbsp;been held accountable by, at minimum, having their license suspended for two years—and dangerous drivers are screened out. And everyone else benefits by having them legally licensed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, three-fourths of people with suspended licenses drive anyway. They just do so without insurance or passing driving exams. Given that there were nearly fourteen thousand vehicle accidents in Durham County in 2017, the third highest number in the state, this isn’t a small consideration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a few people who simply skipped court catch a break along with the others, that’s worth it, proponents say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A person that typically gets a license revoked, they can’t pay,” says Morrill, who has prosecuted traffic cases in Durham for nearly fifteen years. “It started out typically with no operator’s license, or an inspection, or registration, and it just completely, not even snowballed, it fell off the cliff. License revoked, license revoked, license revoked, license revoked. What if we could put a license in their hand? That’s the question. If we’re able to do that and get them driving, that opens up a world of opportunity.”</p>

<p><strong>For cases in which people</strong>&nbsp;had their licenses suspended for missing court, DEAR has taken advantage of a state program designed to efficiently eliminate backlogs of old charges. Through the Administrative Office of the Courts’ Data Integrity Program, Kerr Davis—during her last week as an assistant district attorney in December—dismissed 72,441 cases. Among them was the speeding case that led to Linwood Thornton’s first and longest license suspension, though Thornton didn’t find out until months later. (The other suspensions remain on his record.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, Kerr Davis and outgoing District Attorney Roger Echols chose which categories of offenses and what timeframe to target. The AOC returned a massive spreadsheet of cases in Durham County, and Kerr Davis spent several days individually signing about seven thousand pages of printouts to authorize their dismissal. About fifty thousand cases dealt with traffic matters; the others were nonviolent criminal cases too old to prosecute.</p>



<p>The Data Integrity Program hadn’t been used in this way before. The cases Kerr Davis dismissed accounted for about a third of what the state program had processed by the end of January.</p>



<p>DEAR also identified eleven thousand people with failure-to-pay cases that met its eligibility criteria. Because of how long it takes to prepare each case, they were divided up into dozens of dockets. Beginning in December, the District Attorney’s Office began asking judges to forgive the outstanding debt, most of which is court costs rather than actual traffic fines. It’s unlikely this debt would have been paid; data from the AOC shows that collections drop off a cliff after two years.</p>



<p>But while DEAR has helped tens of thousands of people, many of those people—like Thornton—don’t know they’ve been helped. Left with decades-old addresses, DEAR has been unable to reach them. To remedy that, DEAR launched a website—SecondChanceDriving.org—so people can check if they’ve had an old charge dismissed or traffic ticket waived. The program is also hiring community organizers to spread the word about the website.</p>



<p>“If we think it’s the right thing to do and we want the most people to benefit from expunction or license restoration, we need to design it in a way that’s going to reach as many people as possible,” says I-Team director Ryan Smith.</p>



<p>DEAR hoped to waive debts for two hundred people every week and make its way through the backlog in a year, but that proved to be too burdensome for the clerk’s office.</p>



<p>It takes two people about four hours to prepare forty cases for court, then another forty-five minutes to create and check a docket for the court session. The process doesn’t include the time it takes a judge to look at and sign the motions in each case, or the time it takes the courtroom clerks to pair those documents with the original files or put all those files back on the shelf. So the process has been scaled back to three hundred cases every other week.</p>



<p>(Staffers in the clerk’s office say switching to electronic records—instead of the current analog system—would cut the time they spend preparing DEAR cases in half. But while the state AOC plans to revamp its technology, it won’t do so in the near future.)</p>



<p>On the expunction side, DEAR’s court referral program sends people to the DEAR office as soon as they are found not guilty or their charges are dismissed to file a petition or be referred to a network of providers. Filing an expunction petition takes about forty-five minutes; it takes the courts and the State Bureau of Investigation another four to six months to review it. (DEAR also helps with certificates of relief, which alleviate some of the consequences of a conviction for cases that don’t qualify for an expunction.)</p>



<p>Dionne Gonder, a DEAR advisory board member and N.C. Central law professor who has done expunction work for about a decade, says people often don’t realize the need to expunge charges from their records until the charges show up on a background check when they’re applying for a job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They also don’t realize that serious charges that have been dismissed can prove more problematic on background checks than lower-level convictions, says Daniel Bowes, an attorney with the NC Justice Center working with the DEAR program. Employers, he says, might not notice that the charges were dismissed, or they might judge the person anyway.&nbsp;</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Eventually, DEAR wants</strong>&nbsp;to put a kiosk in the courthouse lobby to walk people through the process of expunging dismissed charges and not-guilty findings on their own, freeing up attorneys to work on expunging convictions, which are more complicated. From there, the goal is to turn that kiosk into an app that anyone in the state can use. &nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s just one way DEAR—which is funded through October, though Smith, the I-Team director, says he hopes to secure funding to keep it going in some form after that—is being built as a model. Other North Carolina counties could use a version of the court-referral process for expunctions, use the state’s Data Integrity Program to drop old charges en masse, or be incorporated into the DEAR website so that people can see if they’ve had charges or debt erased. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But for other counties to adopt the model, they’ll need to commit resources—and they’ll need to see the value in extending relief to as many people with as few barriers as possible. DEAR is figuring out how to do that efficiently in real time, and whether other counties follow suit could hinge on the results.</p>



<p>“We don’t just want people talking to each other—although that’s incredibly helpful in any system, particularly the justice system. We want results,” says Jennifer Lechner, a DEAR advisory board member and executive director of the NC Equal Access to Justice Commission. “I think that’s what DEAR is going to show us. How many licenses can we restore in a given population when everyone is working toward the same goal? How many expungements can we do? How many people can we put back to work and back to having reliable transportation? Those are ultimately the impacts on clients’ lives that we’re looking for.”</p>



<p>Not only is DEAR dealing with these cases on a larger scale than other counties have, but the amount of resources being put into the program marks a change in approach. The program, which became fully staffed in February, has four attorneys based in the courthouse—two full-time on loan from the city attorney’s office and two part-time—as well as a paralegal. The city is also contributing $250,000 from the $400,000 it set aside to match the Bloomberg grant. Even if they do like the mass-relief approach, other counties may not have the budget to make it work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;“If we’re serious about shared prosperity, we’ve got to include everybody,” says Durham Mayor Steve Schewel. “For eighty percent of us, we’re doing great in Durham. These people are among the twenty percent; can we remove some of the very small but important barriers that would make it possible for them to share in our new prosperity?”</p>



<p>DEAR’s partners say license restoration requires a regional, if not statewide, approach—people often cross county lines and have suspensions in multiple jurisdictions. Some counties—including Forsyth, New Hanover, Guilford, and Mecklenburg—have contacted DEAR about following its model, and Lechner says the Equal Access Justice Commission plans to use a grant to spur similar work in three other places in the state.</p>



<p>“I think a lot of jurisdictions will come at this based just on a human toll, but there’s many reasons to come at this,” says Bowes, who lobbies the state on criminal justice reform. “It truly is just a picture of a broken system.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>There appears to be bipartisan interest in fixing some aspects of that broken system. Durham Democrats Floyd McKissick and Marcia Morey have filed bills in the state Senate and House, respectively, to make expungements automatic following dismissals or not-guilty verdicts. McKissick’s Senate Bill 82 is co-sponsored by the two Republicans who co-chair the Senate’s judiciary committee, which bodes well for its chances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there isn’t as much interest in license suspensions.</p>



<p>“I just don’t know that there was the same recognition of these court costs leading to these severe collateral consequences that would forever sentence somebody to a life of not driving legally,” says Bowes. The extent of licenses suspensions in North Carolina wasn’t widely known until data—including the analysis by the Legal Aid Justice Center—came out in 2017, he adds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like North Carolina, most states suspend licenses over unpaid court debt, but over the past two years, five states, including California and Mississippi, as well as Washington, D.C., have ended or limited the practice, and bills to do so are pending in three more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We rarely talk about California and Mississippi together in any kind of reform context, and I think that really goes to show that there’s understanding on the left and the right that this is just bad policy,” says Joanna Weiss, co-director of the Fines and Fees Justice Center, an advocacy group.</p>



<p>Over the past two decades, court costs have gone up 400 percent in North Carolina. Lawmakers have also tried to dissuade judges from waiving them by requiring that they first provide notice to any agency that would lose out on revenue and by ordering annual reports that detail how often individual judges let people not pay. (A bipartisan bill was recently filed in the House to undo both requirements.)</p>



<p>McKissick says he’s not sure there’s an appetite at the General Assembly to reduce fines and fees, and Durham’s efforts may not be “favorably received in the current political environment.” These costs are a revenue source—fines go to public schools, and fees go to police, courts, the state treasurer, and the general fund—and suspending someone’s license is one mechanism to try to collect that money.</p>



<p>Thornton says he’s not angry with the system that caused him to go without a license for three decades. He’s still trying to get out from under some of his suspensions; after that, he’ll need to take a test and get insured to get his license restored. But he knows what he’ll do once that happens. Instead of scraping by with the home improvement business he started because he couldn’t get other work, he’d find a job that would let him save up for retirement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I could tell you a million times: If I had my license I would leave my house in the morning and go find me a job driving buses or something,” he says. “I’m a very good driver.”</p>

<p>Sitting in a classroom in the basement of American Underground’s American Tobacco campus, eight of Code the Dream’s young programmers waited to present their apps to an eager audience last Friday.</p>



<p>But, something made this event different from most tech demos. In fact, something was different about the programmers themselves.</p>



<p>In an industry where 7 percent of employees are black, 8 percent of employees are Hispanic or Latino and only 36 percent of employees are women, most of these programmers were people of color, and a majority were women of color.</p>



<p>Friday’s demo was partly aimed at telling people about the civically oriented apps the Durham-based program’s students created, but also to spread the word about its free programming instruction program that has landed its primarily low-income and immigrant students jobs at companies like IBM, AT&amp;T and a variety of local startups.</p>



<p>Standing in front of the crowd at the pitch event, Executive Director Dan Rearick explained Code the Dream’s mission.</p>



<p>“We envision a world in which everyone does have the opportunity to have those amazing jobs to build that life for themselves,” said Rearick, one of Code The Dream’s Co-Founders. “But, also to do it in a way where they’re actually gaining the experience making apps that make the world a little bit better place.”</p>



<p>During its six-month series of courses, students work during evenings and weekends to learn programming languages and frameworks such as Ruby on Rails and both full-stack and front-end JavaScript.</p>



<p>Although it started solely as free programming lessons in 2014, in the past two years, Code the Dream has expanded to include Code the Dream Labs, where students who have graduated from the training program build their portfolio by creating apps that help the community—while getting paid.</p>



<p>One of these apps is a ride-share program for homeless shelters that improves the coordination between volunteers with cars and recently homeless people who need a ride to job interviews, doctor’s appointments or important errands.</p>



<p>Code the Dream intern Laura Duran, who helped present the ride-share app at the demo day, said Code the Dream is changing the lives of its interns and students.</p>



<p>“I really love to work with people who know your name and appreciate your work,” she said. “I don’t want to be just another number, and I love how Code the Dream really gives back to its community. Since growing up I was always raised to give back, so I’m just carrying on what I’ve learned.”</p>



<h4>Making Tech Careers Accessible</h4>



<p>For Code the Dream Co-Founder and Lead Instructor, Ramiro Rodriguez—who is an immigrant and computer programmer himself—seeing students like he once was becoming confident in their coding abilities is what drives him.</p>



<p>“I discovered that a lot of people are really intimidated with a lot of terminology that is used in computer science,” said Rodriguez, “or they just don’t see themselves as being the person that can think like that or do that kind of work. For me it’s very rewarding to eventually see people changing their minds and thinking they are capable of programming—that they are capable of thinking in those ways and succeeding.”</p>



<p>As the technology industry grows and more and more low-skill jobs are eliminated in the U.S., Rearick said he wants to see immigrants, refugees and people of color benefitting from tech and not being left on the sidelines.</p>



<p>“If you’re a tech lover and you believe that technology does have all this potential to solve the world’s problems,” said Rearick, “then to think that we can get the best outcomes by having only half of the society involved in it is like fighting with one hand tied behind your back.”</p>

<p style="text-align:center" class="has-small-font-size"><em>by Addie Ladner &nbsp;| &nbsp;photography courtesy Code the Dream</em><br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Jorge and Diana in class.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-222" srcset="https://www.codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Jorge%20and%20Diana%20in%20class.jpg 1000w, https://www.codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Jorge%20and%20Diana%20in%20class-600x397.jpg 600w, https://www.codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Jorge%20and%20Diana%20in%20class-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Jorge%20and%20Diana%20in%20class-768x508.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>It’s a Thursday night on Fayetteville Street in downtown Raleigh. While many people are drinking and eating their way through downtown, nearly 20 adults and high school students are sitting above the Foundation Bar at the American Underground Campus. These students come from minority, low-income, or immigrant backgrounds. All of them though, share a desire to learn the language of computers in hopes for a career or life change. Their teacher, Ramiro Rodriguez, is leading a conversation that sounds something like: “A equals C and case C is greater than case B.” They’re coding. Code the Dream is their solution, providing an alternative path to success for these students. Unlike careers in education, law, or medicine that require specific degrees, to be a computer programmer, you just need the skills. Originally a pilot project that began in 2015 under local nonprofit Uniting NC, Code the Dream teaches coding to high school students and young adults. Most of the program participants don’t have the means to attend college or are unable to find work. To date, the program has accepted students from more than 20 countries, including Nepal, India, Pakistan, Argentina, and Venezuela, and the in-depth, hands-on curriculum has produced hundreds of capable web and software developers in the Triangle area.</p>



<p>Daisy Magnus-Aryitey, 36, was once one of those students. She moved here from Ghana at age four. After seven years as a stay-at-home mom, Magnus-Aryitey had a hard time navigating the workforce. She joined Code the Dream and remembers not only her own world expanding, but her daughter’s world too. “My daughter always wanted to be a stay-at-home mom. I started to learn computer programming and her play shifted from cooking and baking to pretending she had an office with post-it notes and a computer,” she says. Magnus-Aryitey went on to be a full-time software developer at Duke University and is now the director at Code the Dream. She advocates for women, especially mothers and encourages them to consider a career in coding. When she started Code the Dream, it was the first time she remembers feeling comfortable with vulnerability. “As a minority, I had always been scared to be vulnerable. But we were all the same. I just knew it would change my life. There was no looking back,” she says. “The students we get don’t have a lot of resources. They’re willing to work so hard and are totally committed to the program and its mission.”</p>



<p>The program at Code the Dream begins with free coding classes in both Durham and Raleigh, starting with Ruby, where students learn the building blocks of computer programming skills. Students advance to more in-depth classes (Ruby on Rails) where they learn app development, JavaScript, HTML, and user interface. The top-performing students move on to Code the Dream Labs, where they’re paid a stipend to build web applications for local nonprofits and businesses. “It’s a win-win—the students get the experience they can use to launch a new career that’s life-changing for them and their families, and the work they’re doing in many cases benefits our community,” says Dan Rearick, executive director and co-founder of Code the Dream.</p>



<p>Crystal Williams-Brown now works as a full-time intern for Code the Dream Labs. At her high school in New Jersey, it was a big deal for students to graduate. She graduated, and went on to earn both a bachelors and an associate’s degree. Yet she still found it difficult to find a full-time job with decent pay. After joining Code the Dream, she’s transitioned from working at Lowe’s Foods to becoming a skilled coder. Williams-Brown is currently working on an app for Families Together, a local nonprofit that connects homeless people with transportation options. She didn’t think she was smart enough to ever be a coder, but her curiosity got the best of her. “If there’s an interest, take the dive,” she says to anyone who is reluctant to get started in coding. With an interest in gaming and schooling in animation, Williams-Brown took naturally to learning computer technology. “I was most surprised when I did my class; I recognized the logic, of computers. It made sense to me,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Manuel Ramos Gonzalez, 24, came to the U.S. from El Salvador when he was six years old. Due to his dedication to Code the Dream, he’s now in the software engineer apprenticeship at IBM. After finishing high school, Gonzalez planned to enroll in a four-year university. His plans changed as he wasn’t eligible for in-state tuition with his temporary protected status as a citizen (he now has his Green Card). He ended up with an associate’s degree and hoped to continue his education, but couldn’t afford to reconsider a four-year university. Thanks to Code the Dream, he had extensive skills, an impressive portfolio, and a fine-tuned resume which earned him the apprenticeship. “It was really a transformative experience for me,” he says. Fernando Ostoro, 23, is originally from Honduras and says Code the Dream was transformative for him as well. He’s now a software developer at Duke. “I enjoy what I do, it’s taught me a lot about logic. Now I see myself as a more logical person in every aspect of my life.” Ostoro enrolled in Code the Dream courses while getting his associate’s degree at a local community college. Along with another student, he developed an app for Student Action with Farmworkers (SAFW) called Conectate Carolina that helps farmworkers find resources in their area.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rearick says that most tech companies today only employee a tiny fraction of black or Latino software developers and engineers. With Code the Dream’s help, however, that is slowly starting to change. “That’s a motivation for what we do. More technology has the possibility to make life better for us,” he says. During the Code the Dream class on Fayetteville Street, Rodriguez, who is a teacher as well as the organization’s co-founder, says something to his students that could simultaneously apply to their lives, not just their programming skills. “There are many different ways to find a solution, sometimes we stumble upon a more complicated one. Trust your gut, it will come with experience.”</p>

<p><iframe id="17636760-iframe" src="https://www.wral.com/news/local/video/17636760/?version=embedded_v2&amp;player_options=%257B%2522embedded_autoplay_next%2522%253Atrue%257D" allowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" class="wral-embedded-player" style="width: 576px; height: 324px; background-color: transparent; border: 0px none transparent; padding: 0px; overflow: hidden;"></iframe></p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.wral.com/news-near-me/13696752/?map_asset_id=17636474">DURHAM, N.C.</a></strong>&nbsp;— A nonprofit group in the Triangle that worked with a technology class in Durham has created a ride-sharing app for families whose relatives have battled homelessness but still need help with transportation.</p>



<p>The &#8220;Ride Together&#8221; app was developed by Crystal Williams-Brown, a student of the &#8220;Code the Dream&#8221; program, which aims to help minority and needy youngsters get a foothold in the sprawling high-tech sector.</p>



<p>Williams-Brown said she struggled to find transportation while trying move into the workforce after graduating college.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2018/06/18/17636758/CrystalWilliams-Brown-DMID1-5f5rm3kfn-640x360.jpg" alt="Crystal Williams-Brown"/></figure>



<p>&#8220;I know when I was struggling to find work, I didn&#8217;t have a car, (and) I didn&#8217;t have money,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s something you need to change your circumstance, a way to get to the place so you can pay for the car.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why she decided to create a ride-sharing app for &#8220;Families Together,&#8221; a group in Raleigh that specializes in helping homeless people find independence.</p>



<p>&#8220;Studies have shown that transportation is one of the reasons families in poverty stay in poverty,&#8221; said Meghan Olesen, a community engagement coordinator.</p>



<p>The app was designed to work like traditional ride-sharing apps used by Uber and Lyft, but there is no cost to those who use it. The app&#8217;s drivers are volunteers who sign up to donate their time.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, essentially the volunteer will sign up (and then) put in their availability, just like they would in a Google calendar,&#8221; Olesen said.</p>



<p>The families then request a ride by submitting a time and place they would like to go.</p>



<p>Helena Harris said she plans to use the &#8220;Ride Together&#8221; app in order to get a ride to work. She currently relies on the city&#8217;s public bus system, which can take hours to transport passengers.</p>



<p>&#8220;If the bus is late, the first thing you do is say you are going to be late,&#8221; Harris said. &#8220;The first thing they say is, &#8216;How late?'&#8221;</p>



<p>Using the Ride Together app, Harris can request a ride at a specific time, which means she may be able to find a better job.</p>



<p>&#8220;I could go further for work (and) be more available for work,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That would let me have more money.&#8221;</p>



<p>Families Together is looking for additional volunteers who are willing to provide transportation to those in need. For more information, go to&nbsp;<a href="https://familiestogethernc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Familiestogethernc.org</a>.</p>

<h2>Code the Dream opens doors, launches careers</h2>



<p><strong>By Mandy Mitchell, WRAL reporter &amp; Hannah Webster, WRAL.com editor</strong></p>



<p>DURHAM, N.C.&nbsp;— A Durham startup is making dreams come true for adults and high school students who want to work in technology.</p>



<p>Code the Dream provides free classes for people who are traditionally under-represented in the technology and computer science industries.</p>



<p>Coding was never the kind of work Daisy Magnus-Aryitey imagined herself doing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Three years ago, I was a stay-at-home mom,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>She said she never considered herself to be “good” with computers, but she now has a successful career as a computer programmer.</p>



<p>&#8220;I know that my life changed,” Magnus-Aryitey said. “My family&#8217;s life changed, just to be able to get into this space and to be able to get into something that I never saw myself doing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her life changed thanks to an organization called Code the Dream, a program that gives people from under-represented populations an entry point into the tech industry.</p>



<p>Magnus-Aryitey, who is originally from Ghana, is now the director. &#8220;Our students are usually first-generation Americans, recent immigrants, minorities, women or people from low-income backgrounds,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Most people involved in the program had never seen a line of code before their first class.</p>



<p>Students quickly learn the basics, and within a year, the best students are building their own apps, usually for non-profits in the Triangle.</p>



<p>&#8220;It means the world. Just to have access to the space. Access to the resources, the instructors and getting your foot in the door,&#8221; student Manuel Ramos Gonzalez said.</p>



<p>They are then able to get jobs in technology and coding, industries with increasingly high demands.</p>



<p>“The best part is watching students progress and remembering where they were just a few months ago,” Executive Director Dan Rearick said.</p>



<p>Crystal Williams-Brown was working in a grocery store before she learned about Code the Dream.</p>



<p>She always had an interest in technology but didn&#8217;t think she could pursue a career in the industry.</p>



<p>&#8220;I would love if it could inspire someone who has brushed it off and said that&#8217;s not for me if someone would just see and hear me and just give it a shot,&#8221; Williams-Brown said.</p>



<p>Code the Dream classes, for high school students and young adults, are available year-round.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now with our classes they come in and say oh I am not the only immigrant. I am not the only person of color I am not the only one in this environment,” Magnus-Aryitey said. “That is what makes code the dream so special.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>by Paola Jaramillo</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A free program offered by a nonprofit organization that has become a bridge for dozens of young immigrants to integrate into the world of Internet page programming.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal of &#8216;Code the Dream&#8217; is to give immigrants the opportunity to open spaces in technology companies where Latinos are not represented,&#8221; Jocelyn Casanova, 21, of Veracruz, Mexico, told La Noticia. After taking the course and remaining linked to the program for more than two years, she is now the outreach coordinator. &#8220;What we do is web applications, that is, Internet pages.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cynthia Ríos, daughter of Peruvian parents, is 16 years old and a student at Garner High School and has been the youngest student to take classes. &#8220;I&#8217;m here a year and a half ago. I feel very happy to have the opportunity to create because you can be what you want. &#8220;</p>
<p>Ríos works together with Rubén Cruz, 23, on a website for Kidznotes, a music education program for minorities. &#8220;I finished regular classes at Durham Tech to enter university because I want to study programming. Next month I start a new job and it&#8217;s thanks to &#8216;Code the Dream&#8217;, &#8220;he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fernando Osorto, 22, who arrived in Honduras 12 years ago, has allowed him to improve his economy and his family. &#8220;When I graduated I worked in carpentry, but now I do programming&#8221;. After taking the classes, Osorto began working with Jorge Rodríguez on the Internet page: conectatecarolina.org, which helps farm workers find resources in their areas.</p>
<p>Those interested in participating should go to the website: www.codethedream.org/classes Calls are opened four times a year and two courses are given in Raleigh and two in Durham. After entering their information they are called for an interview. The basic course lasts from 7 to 12 weeks.</p>
<p>About the requirements, the essential thing is to &#8220;want to learn&#8221; to like science and math, to be between 15 and 25 years old (although they are working on opening the program for adults of that age soon) and to know English.</p>
<p>Classes are free and it does not matter the student&#8217;s nationality, place of residence or immigration status.</p>

<p><strong>Originally published July 29, 2017 in the <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article164392382.html">News &amp; Observer</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anne Blythe ablythe@newsobserver.com</strong></p>
<p>With laptops open, rapt students watched as lines of code stretched across their screens. They were gathered in the American Underground, a startup incubator, to take part in classes organized through <a href="http://www.codethedream.org/">Code the Dream</a>, a program set up to steer people from immigrant, refugee and minority communities into computer programming jobs and tech careers.</p>
<p>Cruz Nunez, a graduate of the program, did a presentation on an app he has been creating for a Raleigh businessman that has the potential to transform business management for private trash haulers across the country.</p>
<p>“I like coding because I like solving problems and I like making web pages look good,” Nunez told the new coders.</p>
<p>The classes are being offered through Uniting NC and the American Underground at a time when the tech industry is being criticized for its lack of diversity.</p>
<p>According to a 2014 <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/reports/hightech/">report</a> by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, black workers account for only 7 percent of the industry’s jobs, Hispanics hold about 8 percent, and women — nearly 47 percent of the overall workforce — make up only 36 percent of the high-tech workforce.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article95495282.html">Ramiro Rodriguez, a Raleigh resident</a> who came to the United States as a child from Mexico, is a founder and lead teacher at Code the Dream. Many immigrants and refugees who might lack the financial resources to pay for their education or support their families have benefited from his willingness to share his experiences and knowledge from working in the tech industry.</p>
<p>Cynthia Rios, a 16-year-old Garner High School student who became the youngest person accepted into program after applying at 14 years old, worked with Ruben Cruz, a 23-year-old Durham resident, to set up a computer site for the Kidznotes music program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I always wanted to find a way to program,” said Cruz, who was tipped off about the program while taking classes at Durham Technical Community College. “It’s really cool here. We have our mentors and we can talk to them about our ideas”</p>
<p>Daisy Howarth, a Ghanaian who came to the United States as a child, was a stay-at-home mom before she found Code the Dream. From those classes she received even more intensive training at the Iron Yard, a coding school that surprised many with its recent announcement that <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article162750093.html">campuses in Raleigh and Durham were closing.</a></p>
<p>Howarth, though, has been able to turn her experience into a job at a university in the area, and she has helped others from Code the Dream climb the industry ladder with her.</p>
<p>Fernando Osorto, 22, who came to this country from Honduras 12 years ago, is one of those people and was applauded on Saturday for landing a job with Howarth.</p>
<p>Osorto did not immediately set out to be a coder. After high school, he worked for a year as a framer before deciding he wanted to try something different.</p>
<p>After taking Code the Dream classes, Osorto worked with Jorge Rodriguez, who always has had a love for technology, on a project for the <a href="http://www.saf-unite.org/">Student Action with Farmworkers</a>.</p>
<p>The idea was to create a portal to help farmworkers, who are often immigrant laborers, find services they need in North Carolina. The site, which offers guidance in Spanish and English, helps farmworkers and their families find health care close to them, education opportunities, legal and immigration assistance, government agencies, housing and job information.</p>
<p>The two also are thinking about other kinds of apps they might try to create.</p>
<p>Rodriguez said his friends were thrilled with a Pinterest-style clone he made in several weeks.</p>
<p>“Coding was a little scary for me at the beginning,” Rodriguez said. “I’ve always been involved in technology. But for me, coming from Spanish and learning English, it’s like I know English, and now I’ve got to learn another language. &#8230;Now I want to make apps that help the world, that help all people.”</p>
