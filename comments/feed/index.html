					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://codethedream.org/virtual-info-session/#comment-1863&quot;&gt;Someone&lt;/a&gt;.

I haven&#039;t done any other bootcamp other than CTD but I do know some bootcamps are ridiculously expensive and either require a loan or a scholarship. For the CTD class, I really liked the consistency, dedication, and passion the teachers brought. I really liked how whenever I had a question someone could answer me more throughly than than the internet can. The students that were in my cohort were the most awesome dedicated people I ever met and there was no competition whatsoever, everyone was there to learn. When in the classes I learned more than I learned at a computer programming class at a technical college. And believe it or not the class leads to an internship in which you learn a lot, even more than when you were in the class.-Lennda]]></description>

Weâ€™ll have a short project at the end of each of our class units (Web Basics I &#038; II, Front End I &#038; II, and Back End I &#038; II). Once you finish the content and complete the project, youâ€™re all set to move on to the next class.
Code the Dream is a project of Uniting NC. Feel free to read about our mission and staff here: https://codethedream.org/about/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi guys. Thank you for answering all our questions. I think for now everything is pretty clear. 
I have a few question: 
1. Do we have an exam? after finishing one course? or we will all pass the course if we pass the assignments? 

2.Can you tell me who is behind this generous opportunity? I want to learn more about the CODE THE DREAM. :)]]></description>

An addition to Irene&#039;s message- like any skill it does take time. Our full class regiment lasts 4-6 months and then our interns usually have a few of months of practice apps before they start building real projects. So before getting a job as a developer, it could take a year or more, realistically. But this is an investment in your future!]]></description>

Chuck: Internships are not capped at any particular length but depend on a particular intern&#039;s skill level and how they are progressing.  Most internships last between 6-12 months, but it varies person to person.]]></description>

Chuck: I&#039;ve never been through another bootcamp so I can&#039;t compare my own experiences.  I can say a few things though: classes through Code the Dream are free and can even lead to a paid internship that offers great hands on experience with all parts of the development life cycle and a stipend to help you while you are still learning.]]></description>

One note- the internship will probably not be available to every person who finishes the class, just because as our classes have increased to give opportunity for more people, we may not have the capacity to offer an internship to every person. There is no guarantee. But you certainly have a good chance if you finish the whole series of classes (Web Basics 1&amp;2, then Front End 1&amp;2 or Back End 1&amp;2).]]></description>
