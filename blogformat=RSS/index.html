"Our students are usually first-generation Americans, recent immigrants, minorities, women or people from low-income backgrounds," she said.</p><p>Most people involved in the program had never seen a line of code before their first class.</p><p>Students quickly learn the basics, and within a year, the best students are building their own apps, usually for non-profits in the Triangle.</p><p>"It means the world. Just to have access to the space. Access to the resources, the instructors and getting your foot in the door," student Manuel Ramos Gonzalez said.</p><p>They are then able to get jobs in technology and coding, industries with increasingly high demands.</p><p>“The best part is watching students progress and remembering where they were just a few months ago,” Executive Director Dan Rearick said.</p><p>Crystal Williams-Brown was working in a grocery store before she learned about Code the Dream.</p><p>She always had an interest in technology but didn't think she could pursue a career in the industry.</p><p>"I would love if it could inspire someone who has brushed it off and said that's not for me if someone would just see and hear me and just give it a shot," Williams-Brown said.</p><p>Code the Dream classes, for high school students and young adults, are available year-round.</p><p>"Now with our classes they come in and say oh I am not the only immigrant. I am not the only person of color I am not the only one in this environment,” Magnus-Aryitey said. “That is what makes code the dream so special."</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Ribbon of Hope grant supports CTD rural expansion</title><dc:creator>Dan Rearick</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 07 May 2018 16:03:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.codethedream.org/blog/2018/5/10/ribbon-of-hope-grant-supports-ctd-rural-expansion</link><guid isPermaLink="false">543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29:5440039de4b0ebb9c704eddc:5af4677270a6ad3849e3673e</guid><description><![CDATA[<img class="thumb-image" data-image="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29/t/5af46cfe0e2e72e4def6803e/1525968161855/" data-image-dimensions="250x185" data-image-focal-point="0.5,0.5" data-load="false" data-image-id="5af46cfe0e2e72e4def6803e" data-type="image" src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29/t/5af46cfe0e2e72e4def6803e/1525968161855/?format=1000w" />
            
          

          

        
      
      
    

  


<p>At Code the Dream, we're always interested to find ways to expand opportunity to those who may have less access. So we were excited to learn recently that we received a Ribbon of Hope grant from the NC GlaxoSmithKline Foundation to do just that -- specifically supporting expanded access to Code the Dream to young people in rural Johnston and Sampson counties. We are very grateful to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ncgskfoundation.org/">NC GlaxoSmithKline Foundation</a> for their support, and look forward to developing talent in an area where many fail to look. We hope to soon be able to replicate this model more broadly and continue moving towards more equitable access to opportunity for all.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Welcome Cruz</title><dc:creator>Dan Rearick</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 02 May 2018 19:31:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.codethedream.org/blog/2018/5/10/welcome-cruz</link><guid isPermaLink="false">543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29:5440039de4b0ebb9c704eddc:5af4653c758d4609774c5b63</guid><description><![CDATA[<img class="thumb-image" data-image="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29/t/5af46581758d4609774c6de3/1525966253697/" data-image-dimensions="250x233" data-image-focal-point="0.5,0.5" data-load="false" data-image-id="5af46581758d4609774c6de3" data-type="image" src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29/t/5af46581758d4609774c6de3/1525966253697/?format=1000w" />
            
          

          

        
      
      
    

  


<p>Cruz Nuñez is now officially our second Code the Dream alumni to come back as program staff.&nbsp;Cruz is an incredibly talented software developer and will take the lead on some of Code the Dream's app development projects for nonprofits and small businesses. Cruz is also a gifted and patient mentor, and we're very glad to have him helping newer Code the Dreamers get their start.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Congrats Jafet, and thank you!</title><dc:creator>Dan Rearick</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 14:08:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.codethedream.org/blog/2018/5/10/congrats-to-jafet-and-thank-you</link><guid isPermaLink="false">543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29:5440039de4b0ebb9c704eddc:5af44df2575d1fcb5260e8e5</guid><description><![CDATA[<img class="thumb-image" data-image="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29/t/5af4519888251bd3a02a4efd/1525965637467/" data-image-dimensions="200x177" data-image-focal-point="0.5,0.5" data-load="false" data-image-id="5af4519888251bd3a02a4efd" data-type="image" src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29/t/5af4519888251bd3a02a4efd/1525965637467/?format=1000w" />
            
          

          

        
      
      
    

  


<p>We recently got a nice, unexpected email from one of our recent Code the Dream grads, Jafet, who last year earned a full scholarship to college:</p><p><em>"Code the Dream provided me with the foundation that is helping me shape my future. The skills I learned through the classes and the multiple phases of the program have allowed me to be very successful in my college career so far. I was the only student in my scholarship cohort of 106 students to obtain a perfect 4.0 GPA for the first semester and I am on track to keep it for my second semester...&nbsp;It's an awesome program and I loved every second of it."</em></p><p>Thank you Jafet! It's wonderful to see all your hard work paying off.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Ruben Goes to Silicon Valley</title><dc:creator>Dan Rearick</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Mar 2018 13:37:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.codethedream.org/blog/2018/5/10/ruben-goes-to-silicon-valley</link><guid isPermaLink="false">543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29:5440039de4b0ebb9c704eddc:5af4489c352f53cd215426e6</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Code the Dream grad Ruben Cruz recently accepted a job with Silicon Valley startup <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nextrequest.com/">Next Request</a>... but fortunately for him he'll only have to head to the Bay Area for occasional meetings.

<p>After a series of information sessions and a record number of interviews held, Code the Dream’s most diverse cohort yet has been selected:</p><ul><li>The cohort is split nearly 50 / 50 men and women.</li><li>Our high school applicants came to us from over a dozen schools across the region.</li><li>Students range in age from 14 - 59.</li><li>Students from immigrant families have roots in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Nigeria, among other places.</li></ul><p>Code the Dream students are hopeful to be the first in their families to attend college or to start their own business. They come from diverse backgrounds, including immigrant families and families trying to get back on their feet. They are hard workers who seek to give back to their communities in a greater way. Every student has unique story that we want to hear more of. As their cohort progresses, our hope is to be able to share bits of their stories with you every couple of weeks.

<p>For many Code the Dream students, the last step before they start getting paid to develop real apps is to take one of their own ideas and turn it into a fully functioning app. It's a big step requiring a lot of work, but on Saturday Crystal, Narayan, Rondale and Cristian were ready to demonstrate what they had created. Each of the the apps -- tentatively known as Bookish, Rating System, Just Married and Mini Facebook -- included features of widely used apps already on the market, but always with a twist. We look forward to seeing what these students will build in the coming months as they jump into their first real projects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Fernando's family came to the United States, they settled in Johnston County. And there the opportunities were still limited, but Fernando pushed on and completed an associates degree at Johnston Community College. He still hadn't given up his dream of learning to code.</p><p>Two years ago, Fernando got an email about Code the Dream. He didn't think twice. He took the 12 week beginner course;&nbsp;then moved on to the intermediate course; and finally advance to making a much needed app for the nonprofit Student Action with Farmworkers (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.saf-unite.org/">SAF</a>).</p><p>Together with fellow CTD grad Jorge Rodriguez, Fernando developed an app called <a target="_blank" href="https://conectatecarolina.herokuapp.com/en">ConectateCarolina.org</a>&nbsp;to help migrant farmworkers find education, health and other resources nearby. For 10 months he worked hard on this app, taking into account feedback from SAF as well as from some of the farmworkers who now use the app.</p><p>Fernando believes learning to code has widened his interest in learning new things. He also believes it has made him more persistent. "For example, when I want to learn something new, coding has taught me to keep on pushing and finish what I want to learn." &nbsp;</p><p>This month Fernando is taking those skills and persistence to a new job as a software developer at Duke University.&nbsp;We are all proud of all the hard work Fernando has put in and all he has achieved as he embarks on his new career.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Javascript Class in Durham</title><dc:creator>Jocelyn Casanova</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2017 20:22:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.codethedream.org/blog/2017/8/15/durham-javascript-class</link><guid isPermaLink="false">543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29:5440039de4b0ebb9c704eddc:5993028b9f745648d6807e51</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Many people pack their bags and sunscreens ready to go on vacation.

They had the chance to learn the basics from their teacher Jared and also had the chance to learn advice from past CTD students.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Originally published July 29, 2017 in the <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article164392382.html">News &amp; Observer</a>.</strong></p><p><strong>Anne Blythe ablythe@newsobserver.com</strong></p><p>With laptops open, rapt students watched as lines of code stretched across their screens. They were gathered in the American Underground, a startup incubator, to take part in classes organized through <a href="http://www.codethedream.org/">Code the Dream</a>, a program set up to steer people from immigrant, refugee and minority communities into computer programming jobs and tech careers.</p><p>Cruz Nunez, a graduate of the program, did a presentation on an app he has been creating for a Raleigh businessman that has the potential to transform business management for private trash haulers across the country.</p><p>“I like coding because I like solving problems and I like making web pages look good,” Nunez told the new coders.</p><p>The classes are being offered through Uniting NC and the American Underground at a time when the tech industry is being criticized for its lack of diversity.</p><p>According to a 2014 <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/reports/hightech/">report</a> by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, black workers account for only 7 percent of the industry’s jobs, Hispanics hold about 8 percent, and women — nearly 47 percent of the overall workforce — make up only 36 percent of the high-tech workforce.</p><p><a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article95495282.html">Ramiro Rodriguez, a Raleigh resident</a> who came to the United States as a child from Mexico, is a founder and lead teacher at Code the Dream. Many immigrants and refugees who might lack the financial resources to pay for their education or support their families have benefited from his willingness to share his experiences and knowledge from working in the tech industry.</p><p>Cynthia Rios, a 16-year-old Garner High School student who became the youngest person accepted into program after applying at 14 years old, worked with Ruben Cruz, a 23-year-old Durham resident, to set up a computer site for the Kidznotes music program.&nbsp;</p><p>“I always wanted to find a way to program,” said Cruz, who was tipped off about the program while taking classes at Durham Technical Community College. “It’s really cool here. We have our mentors and we can talk to them about our ideas”</p><p>Daisy Howarth, a Ghanaian who came to the United States as a child, was a stay-at-home mom before she found Code the Dream. From those classes she received even more intensive training at the Iron Yard, a coding school that surprised many with its recent announcement that <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article162750093.html">campuses in Raleigh and Durham were closing.</a></p><p>Howarth, though, has been able to turn her experience into a job at a university in the area, and she has helped others from Code the Dream climb the industry ladder with her.</p><p>Fernando Osorto, 22, who came to this country from Honduras 12 years ago, is one of those people and was applauded on Saturday for landing a job with Howarth.</p><p>Osorto did not immediately set out to be a coder. After high school, he worked for a year as a framer before deciding he wanted to try something different.</p><p>After taking Code the Dream classes, Osorto worked with Jorge Rodriguez, who always has had a love for technology, on a project for the <a href="http://www.saf-unite.org/">Student Action with Farmworkers</a>.</p><p>The idea was to create a portal to help farmworkers, who are often immigrant laborers, find services they need in North Carolina. The site, which offers guidance in Spanish and English, helps farmworkers and their families find health care close to them, education opportunities, legal and immigration assistance, government agencies, housing and job information.</p><p>The two also are thinking about other kinds of apps they might try to create.</p><p>Rodriguez said his friends were thrilled with a Pinterest-style clone he made in several weeks.</p><p>“Coding was a little scary for me at the beginning,” Rodriguez said. “I’ve always been involved in technology. But for me, coming from Spanish and learning English, it’s like I know English, and now I’ve got to learn another language. ...Now I want to make apps that help the world, that help all people.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Students share their experiences at the Mexican Consulate education fair</title><dc:creator>Jocelyn Casanova</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2017 12:49:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.codethedream.org/blog/2017/7/18/students-share-their-experiences-at-the-mexican-consulate-education-fair</link><guid isPermaLink="false">543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29:5440039de4b0ebb9c704eddc:596e810ad7bdceeadcd956b3</guid><description><![CDATA[<img class="thumb-image" data-image="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29/t/59762ef537c581dd463c7fb0/1500917542206/" data-image-dimensions="2500x1875" data-image-focal-point="0.5,0.5" data-load="false" data-image-id="59762ef537c581dd463c7fb0" data-type="image" src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29/t/59762ef537c581dd463c7fb0/1500917542206/?format=1000w" />

<p>The annual <a href="http://www.thepowerofsharinggala.org/">Power of Sharing</a>&nbsp;awards gala was established to recognize the tremendous impact local nonprofits are making throughout our community. This year Code the Dream was honored to be invited and selected as the runner-up in the Education category, a wonderful recognition for our work. We are also grateful for the $5,000 award, which will allow us to provide an opportunity for more diverse students to hone their talents, gain experience while building apps that benefit our community and eventually achieve their goals of meaningful careers.</p><p>The Power of Sharing is hosted by the Coastal Credit Union Foundation and made possible by an impressive collaborative effort from AT&amp;T, BASF, BCBSNC, Capitol Broadcasting, Citrix, Lenovo, Duke Energy, IBM and the Triangle Business Journal. The event was a unique opportunity to come together with other nonprofits that serve low-income families across central North Carolina and be inspired by their work.&nbsp;Also, it isn’t often that we get to attend a ‘gala’, &nbsp;so that was fun too.

An interview can make or break you by determining if you get the job or don't. Nothing is more frustrating than failing an interview because you weren't prepared for the question they asked.&nbsp;</p><p>Yesterday Code the Dream students and recent grads got a great chance to practice with mock interviews.&nbsp;The interviews were hosted by a generous team of experienced tech gurus at Credit Suisse's Research Triangle Park offices. Students had the opportunity to go through two rounds of interviews as well as get tips and feedback on their resumes.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a great experience, and students left feeling a little less nervous about how they would fair when it came time for the real thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This afternoon Jared Siirila was recognized during the 44th Annual Key Volunteer of the Year &amp; Governor’s Volunteer Service Awards Luncheon for volunteering with <a href="http://www.codethedream.org/">Code the Dream</a>.</p><p>Jared has served as an instructor for multiple Code the Dream classes, giving diverse low-income students the opportunity to take their first steps toward a successful career in technology. He also served as a mentor, guiding students through coding their first real apps for local nonprofits serving our community. Going above and beyond, he originally volunteered to assist 2 hours per day, 3 times a week with one 8-week class but has instead remained involved with nearly nonstop classes for the last 18 months.</p><p>This has allowed Code the Dream to grow and provide opportunities to more students than we could have without him. Although the technology sector is booming, that boom is leaving out many, especially low-income black and Latino youth. Jared is a great example of how people within the established technology sector can share their experience and help students make the leap all the way from low-wage jobs to developing their own apps and eventually building a fulfilling, innovative career.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
